Hi! I am a current cyber security student with profound curiousity in technology, problem solving, IoT and constant learning. I am a Blue/ Purple Teamer whom loves music and cooking for my friends and family. I also enjoy participating in playing basketball and moderate fitness. 

### My Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field. Specifically, I aiming to  venture into the realms of Blue and Purple team SOC strategies. From fundamental concepts to advanced tactics, join me on this journey to fortify defenses, thwart threats, and secure digital landscapes with confidence and proficiency. Overall, I aspire to be an efficient Tier 1 SOC Analyst and grow into a  more seasoned professional.

## GraveSEC Home Lab Projects

I realized the importance of hands-on experience in cybersecurity, especially in a field as dynamic and critical as SOC operations, practical skills would prepare me for real-world scenarios and help me stand out in the job market. I spent some time researching different virtualization platforms and settled on <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview">Proxmox</a> due to its ease of use, robust features, and cost-effectiveness (it's open-source!). I also mapped out my goals for the lab, focusing on key areas like network security, endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and log management.Since I was just starting out, I didn't invest in expensive hardware. I repurposed an old mini desktop PC with decent specs and ensured it had enough RAM and storage to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously.By working on these beginner projects in my Proxmox-based SOC home lab, I was able to develop a solid foundation in cybersecurity concepts and gain valuable hands-on experience that will assist me my career, you may follow my work below.
